// To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on one long-distance run each Saturday. He wants to track how often the number of miles he runs this Saturday exceeds the number of miles run the previous Saturday. This is called a progress day.

// Create a function that takes in an array of miles run every Saturday and returns Johnny's total number of progress days.

// ➞ 2
// There are two progress days, (3->4) and (1->2)
// ➞ 3
