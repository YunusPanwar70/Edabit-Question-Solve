// You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.

// Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:

// ., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]
// There is a hidden message in this string:

const str = "242Edabit23 45can344 3be3 254324addictive!";
const hiddenMessage = str.replace(/\d/g, '');
console.log(hiddenMessage);

// Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden message. You have to remove all of the numbers to reveal the message. Use the character class \D in your expression.

// Notes
// Check the Resources tab for details on character classes if you're stuck.
