// The police send you an electronic statement for you to sign. As you begin to sign, an error pops up. Apparently, they sent you a protected document.

// This challenge is a bit different as the function you are given already contains some code that you should not change or remove. Also, don't do a return statement, it is already included. Your task is, given an object, prevent changes to that object.


const obj = { noChanges: true }

// preventChanges(obj) {
//     // Write your code here, don't use a return statement

//     obj.noChanges = false;
//     obj.signature = "whatever"
//     return obj;

// }
// ➞ { noChanges: true }

console.log(obj.noChanges);
