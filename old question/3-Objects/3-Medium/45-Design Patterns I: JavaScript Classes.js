// Design Patterns I: JavaScript Classes ? !?
//     JavaScript doesn't really have classes like other languages. They are actually functions behind the scenes. There are several ways to create classes.

// Challenge
// Create a Book class using a JavaScript function - instantiable.
// It should have an author and published property.

// Create an Author class using a literal object - singleton.

// It should have a name and books property.

// Create a Publisher class by using the new constructor and an anonymous function - singleton.

// It should have an authors and books property.

// Create a Review class using a class declaration - instantiable.

// It should have a rating and user property.
//     Bonus(optional)
// Create a Bookstore class using an IIFE - singleton.It should have a books and prices property.

//     Notes
// All classes should begin with Capital letters.
// All class properties should have default (initial) values.
// There are a few other ways to make classes but are not in this challenge, you can check the Resources tab to learn more.
