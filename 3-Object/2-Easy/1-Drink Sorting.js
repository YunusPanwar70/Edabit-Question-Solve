// You will be given an array of drinks, with each drink being an object with two properties: name and price. Create a function that has the drinks array as an argument and return the drinks objects sorted by price in ascending order.

// Assume that the following array of drink objects needs to be sorted:

function drinks(obj) {
    let drink = obj.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
    return drink
}
console.log(drinks = [
    { name: "lemonade", price: 50 },
    { name: "lime", price: 10 }
]);
// The output of the sorted drinks object will be:

// sortDrinkByPrice(drinks) âžž [{name: "lime", price: 10}, {name: "lemonade", price: 50}]
