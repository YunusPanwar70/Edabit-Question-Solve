// Write a class called Name and create the following attributes given a first name and last name (as fname and lname):

// An attribute called fullname which returns the first and last names.
// An attribute called initials which returns the first letters of the first and last name. Put a . between the two letters.
// Remember to allow the attributes fname and lname to be accessed individually as well.

a1 = new Name("john", "SMITH")
a1.fname
a1.lname
a1.fullname
a1.initials

// ➞ "John"
// ➞ "Smith"
// ➞ "John Smith"
// ➞ "J.S"


// Notes
// Make sure only the first letter of each name is capitalised.
// Check the Resources tab for some helpful tutorials on JavaScript classes.
